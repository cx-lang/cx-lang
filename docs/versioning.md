# cxLang versioning

We follow a semver-like approach to versioning: `Major.Revision.Release-Tag`

## Major: cxLang Syntax

Every major version follows a different version of the cxLang grammar/parser Syntax.

## Revision: API version

This refers to the library's API version, usage of the API being different if this is different.

## Release: Total release's

Total number of release's made to NPM and the community.

## Tag: Release identifier

A tag refers to a specific release cycle, distinguishing different objectives and goals as well as versions.
