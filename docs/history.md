I initially conceived the idea for this language in 2011, but barely got anything done as I became absorbed in other things (Xenoblade Chronicles) as well as learning PEG.js to create a parser for cx-lang. By late 2012 I had started work on the parser, and had a awkward but working version based on the JavaScript grammar included with PEG.js, but this was lost when my computer _literally_ crashed and burned (no fire, thank god). Didn't restart working on it properly until 2014.
