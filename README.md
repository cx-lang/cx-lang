CXLang is a statically typed programming language that has borrowed it's syntax from dynamic languages, and can transpile to any language you define.

## Version

- Development: [0.5.0](https://github.com/cx-lang/cx-lang/tree/v0.5)<br>
- Release:     [0.0.1]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/cx-lang)

I originally started work on this computer language sometime in 2013/2014, but as there have been so many rewrites of the the parser and compiler, it's ridicules to set a version based on that alone. So considering that I started working on parsers and compilers in 2011, and that this project has yet to reach v1, I decided that starting its official version from v0.5 is justified.
